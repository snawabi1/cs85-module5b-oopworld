# AI Method Critique

## Prompt Used:
Generate a PHP method that estimates how many days are left to finish a book, based on pages read and a user-supplied daily reading rate.

## Raw AI-Generated Code:
```php
public function estimateDaysLeft($pagesPerDay) {
    if ($this->isComplete || $pagesPerDay <= 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    $pagesLeft = $this->totalPages - $this->pagesRead;
    return ceil($pagesLeft / $pagesPerDay);
}

## Critique:

- **Correctness**: The method correctly uses `ceil()` to ensure partial days round up. Logic accounts for completed books and invalid input (â‰¤0).
- **Security**: No external input or database handling, so no vulnerabilities like XSS or SQL injection are possible.
- **Efficiency**: The method is lightweight and efficient, suitable for frequent calls.
- **Style**: Follows good naming practices and includes clear docblocks. Clean and readable.
- **Changes Made**: No code changes were necessary. The logic and formatting were solid.

## Conclusion:
This method integrates well into the `ReadingTracker` class and adds practical value for users tracking their progress.
